        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          I don't know how to meditate, but I guess it is a very quiet process, when all that is left on the world is breath.Now imagine a clock with a cycle of 60, it has the same breath rate as human,it has day and night,if possible, maybe one day in the future, it could record the weather, the motion, many other things more than breath. But what doesn't change is time flowing through the process of breathing and breath itself.Time is breath, but maybe more than that.

        <h1>Reflection of my idea</h1>
        <p>
          At the very beginning, the reason why I'd like to create the "breathing clock" is just derived from one simple sentence which is, of course, not from any celebrities, but just a sentence popping up into my head. I don't know how the clock would be used, but just think breath itself could be beautiful. Then Matt told me that maybe the clock could be used for meditation because meditation is all about breath. So I came to consider about the breathing rate of the clock, the day-and-night cycle of the clock, trying my best to make the clock closer to a human, maybe in one day it could really adjust its breathing rate according to emotion, weather, etc. But now it's just a simple breathing clock, with <span>a light on the top, and a slider at the bottom which could be used to change the breathing rate</span>Furthermore, the number in the clock, the text of "Time is breath" at the top all having the same breathing rate, <span>during the process in which the number approaches the screen,  it could be noticed that the number is running slower, which is similar to the process of exhale. And vice versa for the process in which the number is keeping away from the screen, making it similar to the process of inhale. Maybe in the future, like what the introduction has mentioned, the clock would adjust itself according to the weather and people's emotional state, which makes itself a more human-like clock.

        <h1>Documentation of process</h1>
        <p>
          The whole process of designing, is mainly about coding and thinking of the layout. Fortunately, I don't include any images in the design so it has saved me some time and effort. While at first I had trouble with the javascript about how to adjust the time interval of the second, making it change according to breathing rate, I tried many methods and finally find I've misused the function, which should be <span>setTimeout(), instead of setInterval()</span>, and other problems include using the slider to control the breathing rate, which includes <span>connecting the value of the slider with the function of the second hand</span>, and other problems include <span>how to make the animation duration consistent with the breathing cycle,</span> etc. During the process, I've learned a lot about javascript, eventually could realize the expected design effect without worrying about whether it could be written in code.</p>
        <p>And the following are some useful resources I've referred to</p>
