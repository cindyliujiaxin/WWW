          <li>Independence day</li>
          <p>I used to think on Independence day, Americans just goes on holiday, It's really surprising when I see all the faculties in Yale still work, but there is still ways to celebrate it even if we have to work.</p>
          <li>walking on the street</li>
          <p>Sky in America is really beautiful, It's really a pity that I didn't bring my camera here, the mobile phone simply cannot satisfy my desire for documenting all the beauty here.</p>
