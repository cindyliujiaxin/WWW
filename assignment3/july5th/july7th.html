      <b>Just nothing to say today, all time spent on homework!!</b>So actually I find passion in writing html because unlike Python or other programming language, if you write a wrong programme, it simply cannot be run, and the process of debugging is extremely painful, but writing a html is a process of creating, you just write whatever you like on the webpages, if you don't know how to realize the expected effect, you can just choose another way to express it!And there are variable resources to be found on the Internet, which enables us to stand on the giants' shoulder.<p></p>So actually I was thinking about these questions:<p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How do search engines work?Is it possible to create a search engine for a specific organization?like Yale search engine?
        </li>
        <li>
          How to realize the interact between webpage users, like the users can establish comments on the webpage, and others can also see it.
        </li>
        <li>
          How to organize the location of words and pictures on the webpage.The present skills only allow me to put them up and down.
