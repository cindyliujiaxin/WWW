      					I finally decided to change my courses to WWW after consulting several classmates, my original courses are called the "Business of Hollyhood", sounds like close to my major, but most of the knowledge has been studied before and the homework workload just fell out of my bearable scope, so I finally decided to step outside my comfort zone. The new classes' content is brand new to me, but the chance finally came that I can get in touch with something new!

      					All the things seem to pile up on the same day, the homework from another course involves reading Aristotle, figuring out the great philosopher's logic costs me huge effort
